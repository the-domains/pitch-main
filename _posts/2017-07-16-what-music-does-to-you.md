# What music does for you

Music makes your brain release endorphins, opioid-like substances that give you a "high", except it's natural, legal and healthy

... and oxytocin, the "bonding hormone", the same one new mothers get when their babies are born

Music also makes your brain release less cortisol than it regularly does. Cortisol, the stress hormone, is harmful to your health, so having less of it is a good thing.

Music has been shown to improve lung function, general health, and life expectancy.
